       <h2>Description</h2>
       <p>These copycat Cheesecake Factory Buffalo blasts are crispy fried wontons with Buffalo chicken filling,

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups shredded cooked chicken</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>1/3 cup Buffalo wing sauce</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 tablespoons water</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>24 wonton wrappers</li>
            <li>3 cups canola oil</li>
            <li>celery sticks, extra Buffalo sauce, and blue cheese dressing for dipping</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps:</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Combine chicken, cheese, and wing sauce in a bowl and mix well. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Whisk eggs and water together in a shallow dish. Whisk flour and salt together in a separate shallow dish.</li>
            <li>Working with one wonton wrapper at a time, place 1 to 2 teaspoons chicken filling in the center of the wrapper.
             Dip finger or brush in egg and brush lightly around the edges of the wrapper</li>
            <li>Fold the wrapper over the filling in a half triangle shape, pressing to seal the edges.  
                Set aside and repeat with remaining filling and wrappers. Do not discard egg mixture.</li>
            <li>Preheat oil to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C) in a deep saucepan over medium to medium-high heat. Lightly dredge stuffed wonton in flour mixture, then dip in egg mixture and let excess drip off.
                 Coat again lightly in flour, dip in egg and lightly coat in flour once more, creating a double breading.  </li>
            <li>Working in batches, fry stuffed wontons for 2 minutes, flipping occasionally, until golden brown and flaky. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate. Repeat with remaining pieces. 
                Serve immediately with extra Buffalo sauce, blue cheese dressing, and celery.</li>
            <li>Alternatively, drain on a rimmed baking sheet lined with a wire rack and keep warm in an oven preheated to 200 degrees F (93 degrees C) until ready to serve.</li>
        </ol>
