        <h1>Description:</h1>
        <p>This broccoli cheese soup is the real copycat Panera broccoli Cheddar soup, and it is as delicious, 
            creamy, and cheesy as the original. Serve with crusty bread and more cheese on top.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

            <li>3 tablespoons flour</li>
            <li>2 cups milk</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups shredded Cheddar cheese, plus more for topping (Optional)</li>
            <li>8 ounces processed Cheddar cheese, such as Velveeta, cubed</li>
            <li>2 cups chicken stock</li>
            <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 cup matchstick-cut carrots, roughly chopped</li>
            <li>3 cups chopped broccoli</li>
            <li>1 ½ tablespoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon white pepper</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons hot sauce</li>
            <li>crusty bread for serving (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add onion; cook, stirring often, until soft and translucent, 
                about 5 minutes. Add in flour and cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly. 
                Whisk in milk and mustard and bring to a boil, stirring occasionally.
                 Reduce heat to a simmer and cook until thick and creamy, 6 to 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in Cheddar and Velveeta and cook, stirring constantly, until melted. Add in chicken stock, cream, carrots, 
                and broccoli and cook until vegetables are tender, 10 to 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. 
                Season with salt, pepper, and hot sauce and cook for 2 minutes more. 
                Remove from heat and serve with crusty bread and more cheese on top if desired.</li>
